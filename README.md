email-is-the-issue
==================

Is email an issue for you? This thing can fetch emails from your Gmail inbox and push them onto GitHub as issues. When emails get updated, so do the issues.

This is a Google Apps script. Go to [script.google.com](<https://script.google.com/>), create a new project, and paste `.js` file in. Then set a trigger to run `main()` every minute.


To-do
-----

- Support closed issue <=> archived email equivalence
- Allow manually triggering update of existing issues and issue comments
